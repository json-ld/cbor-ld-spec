    <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

    <p>CBOR-LD satisfies the following design goals:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Simplicity</dt>
      <dd>
Implementations should be simple to implement given an existing JSON-LD
implementation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Efficient Storage</dt>
      <dd>
The encoding process should generate an aggressively compact Linked Data binary
format.
      </dd>
      <dt>Generalized Algorithm</dt>
      <dd>
The encoding algorithm must be generalized.
      </dd>
      <dt>Semantic Compression</dt>
      <dd>
The encoding format should maximize compression of Linked Data URLs (terms and
values). Focusing here ensures that the algorithms can achieve compression
ratios better than generalized compression algorithms.
      </dd>
      <dt>Raw Binary</dt>
      <dd>
Base-encoded binary values, and other compressible data types, should be
translated to their raw binary forms from base-encoded formats when possible
without sacrificing generality.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
Similarly, the following are non-goals.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Theoretical purity.
      </li>
      <li>
Creating new compaction/expansion algorithms specifically for CBOR-LD.
      </li>
      <li>
Large centralized registries for every term on the planet.
      </li>
      <li>
Data formats that require large spec changes or complex implementations to
roundtrip from JSON-LD to CBOR-LD and back.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
The following minefields have been identified while working on this
specification:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
While it is widely believed that hashing is fast, it's slower than string
comparison over a small set of strings. This is true because in order to hash,
you must consume the entire string. If you are performing string comparisons,
you can abort the second the byte-for-byte comparison fails. That is, when
processing two values, string comparison can abort processing and hashing
cannot. While most globally collision-resistant hashes are 256-bits, 32 byte
values are large and we can do better in many cases without sacrificing
collision resistance (which hashing algorithms like blake2b-8 cannot do).
      </li>
      <li>
Anything that requires you to pre-process the JSON-LD data is a non-starter --
it's expensive, and that means that you are encoding semantics in the data.
While this can lead to better compression in some cases, it increases the
complexity of the processors without providing an acceptable return on
investment.
      </li>
      <li>
Scoped contexts are the most challenging aspect of a more generalized solution.
The deeper the algorithm has to understand scoping, the more combinatorial the
problem becomes and thus the more possible compression values there are, which
harms compression size. The trick is to leverage the determinism in the existing
JSON-LD Processing algorithms and take shortcuts only when it won't affect
JSON-LD processing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Basic Concept</h1>

    <p>
The general CBOR-LD encoding algorithm takes a JSON-LD Document and does
the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Determine if JSON-LD can be compressed (@context values in JSON-LD document that
reference contexts via URLs - embedded context values cannot be compressed)
      </li>
      <li>
Process a JSON-LD Context, building a CBOR-LD term codec map -- a list
of all terms that can be compressed (and whether or not their values can be
compressed). Sort the list. Associate byte values with each term starting at 0
and counting up.
      </li>
      <li>
Encoding the JSON-LD Document as CBOR-LD consists of replacing every key with
the byte value associated with the term. For every value that is `"@type":
"@id"`, replace the value with the byte value associated with the term.
      </li>
      <li>
Decoding the CBOR-LD Bytes as JSON-LD consists of replacing every CBOR key with
the associated value in the term codec map. For every value that is
`"@type": "@id"`, replace the value with the byte value associated with the
term.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="normative">
    <h1>CBOR Tags for CBOR-LD</h1>
    <p>
The first step in decoding a CBOR-LD payload is to recreate the term codec
map that was used to encode it by processing the contexts in the payload. However,
the contexts needed to create the term codec map can have their URLs encoded as integers
by CBOR-LD. If a CBOR-LD payload contains context URLs compressed in such a way, the
consumer of the CBOR-LD must know what `Compression Table` (map from JSON-LD terms to integers)
was used to compress the context URLs during creation to be able to reconstruct the term codec
map. The following sections define the exact mechanism by which this can be accomplished, allowing 
an arbitrary CBOR-LD consumer to decompress any CBOR-LD payload meeting this specification.
    </p>
    <p>
To this end, we have registered the range of CBOR tags 1536-1791** (0x0600-0x06FF) to be used for CBOR-LD,
where data that includes tag value is used to lookup what `Compression Table`(s) are needed
to decompress the CBOR-LD context URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>**Note:</b> this exact range of tag values has not yet been officially registered with
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">the IANA CBOR
Tag Registry</a>. The exact range is subject to change.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>CBOR-LD Varint</h2>
      <p>
To enable unbounded extension on possible use cases for CBOR-LD that require different
`Compression Table` material for consumption while working within a fixed number of
CBOR tag values, we define the following.
      </p>
      <p>
Implementers MUST interpret the last byte of the two-byte CBOR tag value on a CBOR-LD payload
as the beginning of a varint. If the CBOR tag is in the range (0x0600-0x067F), the last byte of
the CBOR tag is a one-byte varint. If the CBOR tag is `0x0680` or greater, the first item in the
CBOR payload MUST be a major type 2 byte string containing the rest of the varint. See Algorithm <a
href="#get-cbor-ld-varint-structure-algorithm"></a> for
more information.
      </p>
      <p>
The value of this varint is then used to lookup a <b>CBOR-LD Varint Registry Entry</b> in the
<b>CBOR-LD Varint Registry</b>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>CBOR-LD Varint Registry</h2>
      <p>
The <b>CBOR-LD Registry</b> is a global list that provides
consumers of CBOR-LD payloads the information they need to reconstruct the term codec map
required for decompression. A <b>CBOR-LD Varint Registry Entry</b> contains the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
Registry Entry Value: a positive integer.
          </li>
          <li>
Use Case: what type of CBOR-LD payload this entry is used for.
          </li>
          <li>
`typeTables`: an array containing what `Type Tables` must be used for this
type of payload.
          </li>
          <li>
`processingModel`: what processing model is used for this registry entry. A processing model
specifies how auto-generated CBOR-LD values are created from JSON-LD contexts as well as what
type encoders are used alongside the `Type Tables` (e.g. how to partially compress an 
`xsd:dateTime` value that does not appear in `Type Table`). The default processing model,
which will be defined later in this specification, will be used unless otherwise specified
in the Registry Entry.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
The `typeTables` associated with a <b>CBOR-LD Varint Registry Entry</b> MUST be an array of
or JSON objects. The only exception is the string "callerProvidedTable", which may appear in this array,
denoting that for this use case, a `Type Table` is required which is not globally
defined.
      </p>
      <p></p>
Dereferencing one of these URLs MUST result in a JSON object with the following properties:
      <ol>
        <li>
`type`: a JSON-LD type.
        </li>
        <li>
`table`: a JSON object that maps values of the above type to integers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
If a JSON object is present in the `typeTables` array, it MUST be in the above format.

      <h2>JSON-LD to CBOR-LD Algorithm</h2>

      <p>
This algorithm takes JSON-LD objects `jsonldDocument` and `options` as well 
as an integer `varintValue` as input.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let `result` be an empty CBOR-encoded byte array.</li>
        <li>
Set {`varintTagValue`, `varintBytesValue`} to the return value of the "Get CBOR-LD Varint Structure
Algorithm", passing `varintValue` as input.
        </li>
        <li>
If the "Get CBOR-LD Varint Structure Algorithm" resulted in an error, set `result` to the
return value of the "Generate Uncompressed CBOR-LD Algorithm".
        </li>
        <li>
Otherwise:
          <ol>
            <li>
Initialize `contextUrlMap` and `termMap` to empty maps.
            </li>
            <li>
For each entry in the `contextTables` array in the <b>CBOR-LD Varint Registry Entry</b> 
associated with `varintValue`, dereference the URL and add all entries in the
`contextCompressionMap` map in the resulting document to `contextUrls`. If "callerProvidedTable"
appears in `contextTables`, populate `contextUrls` with `options.callerProvidedTable` as well.
Then, add all entries in `termCompressionMap` to `termMap`.
            </li>
            <li>
Set `result` to the return value of the "Generate Compressed CBOR-LD
Algorithm" passing `contextUrls` as `options.contextUrls`, `termMap` as `options.termMap`,
`varintTagValue` as `options.varintTagValue`, and `varintBytesValue`

      <h2>Uncompressed CBOR-LD Buffer Algorithm</h2>

      <p>
This algorithm takes a JSON-LD object `jsonldDocument` and `options` as
input.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let `result` be an empty CBOR-encoded byte array.</li>

0x00, Tag 1280))
        </li>
        <li>
For every key-value in the map, generate the Uncompressed CBOR-LD
Buffer by converting it to the associated CBOR-LD header and value. For
complex values (maps, arrays), recursively convert the value to
something that will losslessly encode and decode back to JSON-LD.

      <h2>Get Term Codec Map Algorithm</h2>

      <p>
This algorithm takes two maps `contextUrls` and `termMap` and returns a CBOR-LD
term codec map that maps JSON-LD terms to their associated byte values
and value compression functions.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let `result` be an ordered map.</li>

Let `compressor` be a known global compressor function associated with the
`@type` property, a compressor for this entry provided in `termMap`,
function, or the generic CBOR compressor function, which returns the bytes
associated with a typical CBOR compression of the given datatype.
